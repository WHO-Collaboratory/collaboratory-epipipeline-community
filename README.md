## About
This GitHub community space aims to advance the World Health Organization's (WHO) work in responding to health emergencies and contributes to WHO’s General Programme of Work outcome 2.2 Epidemics and pandemics prevented. It builds upon the insights gained from previous technical activities which identified various challenges and opportunities related to consistent, reliable, and timely outbreak analytics.
To further enhance outbreak response capabilities, this community will focus on the development of reusable analytical pipelines in R, specifically designed for predictable tasks and data structures involved in responding to infectious disease outbreaks. The ultimate goal is to address common questions and tasks that hold crucial importance in the early stages of an outbreak, such as estimating severity, transmissibility, and comparing control options for known pathogens. 
This GitHub page provides a community space for the joint development and extension of R Pipelines for Selected priority tasks .This engagement will catalyze the development of robust and consistent analytical frameworks, enabling WHO to respond more effectively to health emergencies. 

## How to contribute
### Ways to Contribute:
Engage in Discussions: Join the conversation by asking questions, sharing insights, and exchanging ideas. Your expertise can help shape effective analytical pipelines and responses to infectious disease outbreaks.
Participate in Code Development: Contribute to the development and extension of R pipelines for selected priority tasks. Collaboratively work on enhancing the robustness and consistency of analytical frameworks, enabling WHO to respond more effectively to health emergencies.
Follow the Code of Conduct: Our community is committed to creating a welcoming and diverse environment. We invite you to read and adhere to our Code of Conduct to ensure that this space remains safe and respectful for all contributors.
### Getting Started:
Engage: Start by exploring the existing discussions and ongoing projects. Share your thoughts and ideas, and feel free to ask questions.
Collaborate: If you're a developer or data scientist, you can contribute by enhancing the R pipelines for selected tasks. Your skills can have a significant impact on improving outbreak response capabilities.
